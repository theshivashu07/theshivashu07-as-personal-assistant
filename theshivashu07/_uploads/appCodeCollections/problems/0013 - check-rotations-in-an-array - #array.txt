Given an ascending sorted rotated array Arr of distinct integers of size N. The array is right rotated K times. Find the value of K.

Example-1: 
N = 5,  Arr[] = {5, 1, 2, 3, 4}
Output: 1 

Example 2:  
N = 5,  Arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
Output: 0


Your Task:
Complete the function findKRotation() which takes array arr and size n, as input parameters and returns an integer representing the answer. You don't to print answer or take inputs.

Given an array, the task is to write a program to print all the LEADERS in the array.

What is a Leader? 
An element is a leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side. And the rightmost element is always a leader. 


 
For example:

Input: arr[] = {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}, 
Output: 17, 5, 2
 
Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2}, 
Output: 5, 2

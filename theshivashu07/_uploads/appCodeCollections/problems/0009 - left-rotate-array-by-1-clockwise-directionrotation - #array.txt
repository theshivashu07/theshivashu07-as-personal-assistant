Given an array, the task is to Left Rotate an Array by One Position in clock-wise direction.

What is meant by the Left Rotation of an Array by One?
Left Rotation means a rotation that happens Counter-Clockwise (anticlockwise). The elements are moved counterclockwise by one, which results in the elements moving back by one position from their initial position.

Example-1:
Input:  arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: arr[] = {2,3,4,5,1}

Example-2:
Input:  arr[] = {30,5,20}
Output: arr[] = {5,20,30}


Your Task:  
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function leftrotate() which takes the array A[] and its size N as inputs and modify the array in place.

Given an unsorted array arr[] of size N. Rotate the array to the left (counter-clockwise direction) by K steps, where K is a positive integer.  

Example 1:  
N = 5,  K = 2,  arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: 3 4 5 1 2

Example 2:
N = 10, K = 3,  arr[] = {2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20}
Output: 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 2 4 6
 

Your Task:
You need not print or read anything. You need to complete the function rotateArr() which takes the array, K and N as input parameters and rotates the array by K elements. The array must be modified in-place without using extra space.
